As you advance, you will gain an in-depth understanding of Python libraries such as NumPy and pandas for analyzing financial datasets, and explore Matplotlib, statsmodels, and scikit-learn libraries for advanced analytics. Youâ€™ll also focus on time series forecasting, covering pmdarima and Facebook Prophet.

By the end of this trading book, you will be able to build predictive trading signals, adopt basic and advanced algorithmic trading strategies, and perform portfolio optimization.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Discover how quantitative analysis works by covering financial statistics and ARIMA
* Use core Python libraries to perform quantitative research and strategy development using real datasets
* Understand how to access financial and economic data in Python
* Implement effective data visualization with Matplotlib
* Apply scientific computing and data visualization with popular Python libraries
* Build and deploy backtesting algorithmic trading strategies

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4) = plt.subplots(4, figsize=(12, 12), sharex=True)

x = np.linspace(0, 10, num=20)
y1 = np.exp(x)
y2 = x ** 3
y3 = np.sin(y2)
y4 = np.random.randn(20)

ax1.plot(x, y1, color='black', linestyle='--', linewidth=5, marker='x', markersize=15)
ax2.plot(x, y2, color='green', linestyle='-.', linewidth=2, marker='^', markersize=10, alpha=0.9)
ax3.plot(x, y3, color='red', linestyle=':', marker='*', markersize=15, drawstyle='steps')
ax4.plot(x, y4, color='green', linestyle='-', marker='s', markersize=15)

```
